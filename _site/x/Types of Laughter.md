There seems to be a distinction in a lot of what I read between different types of "laughter". Neuroscientists like [[Sophie Scott]] and [[Robert Provine]] seem to be just as interested (if not more) in the social aspects of laughter which they have found aren't always in response to a funny stimulus. 

They talk about **genuine** laughter and **performed** laughter.

# Performed laughter
Performed laughter seems to be what we do to oil the social wheels and signify things to people. This is fine and I think represents how [[The repurposing of laughter|laughter has been repurposed]] and so whilst it's fascinating from a sociological standpoint it doesn't tell us about what makes something funny. 

# Genuine laughter
Genuine laughter is a response to something actually funny. The question I'm interested in is: What makes a thing funny? So it really is only "genuine laughter" I'm interested in.

Whenever I talk about laughter I'll tend to use the word "genuine" where possible
