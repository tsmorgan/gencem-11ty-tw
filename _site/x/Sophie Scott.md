Neuroscientist and stand-up comedian.

In this [BBC video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu5j_rODT9o&ab_channel=BBCIdeas) she explains about the social aspect of laughter. She talked about how laughter is contagious and how other apes clearly laugh. 

I think the thing that's interesting is how she's talking about how we've come to [[The repurposing of laughter|use laughter]] more than the spontaneous aspect of it. We've come to use it as a social cue, or a signal to others about our feelings and intensions, which is really interesting, but that's a layer above the actual [[Types of Laughter|genuine laughter]]. 

Surely we need to understand what laughter is about and then we can see how we've repurposed it as a signifier and a useful social lubricant?

She also did a [Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/sophie_scott_why_we_laugh?language=en).

She also did a [talk for Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjFTQc8NZtM&ab_channel=TalksatGoogle) (48mins)

There's [an interview with her on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYIimm0-0SQ&ab_channel=Powerhouse) where she covers similar ground.
