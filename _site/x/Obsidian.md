Obsidian is the wiki editor I'm using to write the content for this site. Discovering it has been a revelation for me. It allows me to really quickly and easily put together a bunch of notes like this and link them up in useful ways etc. And it stores everything as markdown so turning it into a website was ... relatively easy. ;-)
