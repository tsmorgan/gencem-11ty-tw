I just want to make it clear that I'm not claiming to have read absolutely everything about all the [[theories of comedy]]. I'm not an academic, and I haven't studied any of this in anything other than a spare-time, finding-it-interesting kind of way.

Part of the point of this website is as a way for me to scratch a mental itch and for me that involves a kind of open exploration of these ideas, quite often just from my own head. This is much more about an attempt to put those ideas in order, rather than to make any claims for their value, or originality.

Where I've failed to reference or give credit to people who got there first it is genuinely because I wasn't aware of them or their particular work. So if any of the ideas contained here overlap with previous work of other people, do please [let me know](http://twitter.com/tsmz) and I will immediately reference or give those people credit in as prominent way as I can, and if anything crosses the line further than that I will happily remove it.

I know this is a bit of a get-out-of-jail-free card, but the alternative was to read absolutely everything before I even started, and frankly I can't be bothered! ;-)
