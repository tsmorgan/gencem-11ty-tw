# Hormones
Laughter reduces the level of stress hormones like [cortisol](https://www.verywellmind.com/cortisol-and-stress-how-to-stay-healthy-3145080), [epinephrine](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-epinephrine-3145108) (adrenaline), [dopamine](https://www.verywellmind.com/dopamine-medical-glossary-definition-425296), and growth hormone. It also increases the level of health-enhancing hormones, like endorphins.

Laughter increases the number of antibody-producing cells we have working for us and enhances the effectiveness of T cells. All this means a stronger immune system, as well as fewer [physical effects](https://www.verywellmind.com/stress-and-health-3145086) of stress.

# Internal Workout
A good belly laugh exercises the diaphragm, contracts the abs, and even works out the shoulders, leaving muscles more relaxed afterward. It even provides a good workout for the heart.

# How to laugh away stress - Nature
Here is a [great article in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/news.2008.741) which talks about laughter producing "mood-elevating hormones called Î²-endorphins" and "the immunity-enhancing human growth hormone".

They state: "This led the team to wonder whether the link between lowered blood pressure and laughter could be **the result of laughter somehow interfering with the production of stress hormones**."

The research was by "Lee Berk at Loma Linda University in California".
