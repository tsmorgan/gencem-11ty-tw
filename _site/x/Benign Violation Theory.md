There are many [[theories of comedy]] (or humour) out there but [[Benign Violation Theory]] seems to me to be the best one. It makes sense to me and, as you'll see elsewhere, I think the consequences of it are really interesting for talking about all sorts of comedy.

I first heard about the theory in [[Peter McGraw]]'s [Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysSgG5V-R3U&ab_channel=TEDxTalks) about it. It's worth a watch. McGraw set up the [HuRL Humour Research Laboratory](https://humorresearchlab.com/) and wrote [a book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1451665423/) about the theory with Joel Warner.

One of the motivations for this website is the desire I have to explore that theory more and to try and use it to look at (and maybe even [[deconstruct]]) some of the comedy I like in order to try and understand it better.
